                        (surname).Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar BR (/ˌsʌtʃɪn tɛnˈduːlkər/ (listen); pronounced [sət͡ʃin
                        t̪eːɳɖulkəɾ]; born 24 April 1973) is an Indian former international cricketer who captained the
                        Indian national team. Nicknamed "The Little Master"[4] and "Master Blaster"[5], he is regarded
                        as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.[6] He is the all-time highest
                        run-scorer in both ODI and Test cricket with more than 18,000 runs and 15,000 total runs
                        respectively.[7] He also holds the record for receiving the most man-of-the-match awards in
                        international cricket.[8] Known for his large fanbase and described by ESPNcricinfo as 'the most
                        worshipped player in the world'.[9] <br> <br> Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven,
                        made
                        his Test match debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and
                        went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four
                        years. In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden ranked him the second-greatest Test batsman
                        of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv
                        Richards.[10] Later in his career, Tendulkar was part of the Indian team that won the 2011
                        Cricket World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India.[11] He had previously
                        been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 edition of the tournament.
                        <br> <br> Tendulkar received the Arjuna Award in 1994 for his outstanding sporting achievements,
                        the Khel Ratna Award, India's highest sporting honour, in 1997, and the Padma Shri and Padma
                        Vibhushan awards in 1999 and 2008, respectively, two of India's highest civilian awards.[12][13]
                        A few hours after the end of his last match in November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office
                        announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.[14][15] As
                        of 2021, he is the youngest recipient to date and was the first sportsperson to receive the
                        award.[16][17] In 2012, Tendulkar was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the
                        Parliament of India.[18] <br> <br> In 2010, Time magazine included Tendulkar in its annual Time
                        100
                        list as one of the most influential people in the world.[19] Tendulkar was awarded the Sir
                        Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the 2010 ICC Awards.[20] Having retired from
                        ODI cricket in 2012,[21][22] he retired from all forms of cricket in November 2013 after playing
                        his 200th Test match.[23] Tendulkar played 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring
                        34,357 runs.[24] In 2013, Tendulkar was included in an all-time Test World XI compiled in 2013
                        to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, and he was the only specialist
                        batsman of the post–World War II era, along with Viv Richards, to get featured in the team.[25]
                        In 2019 he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.[26] <br> <br> 
                         <h1>Early Years</h1> <br>  </p>
                       <p> Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973[27][28] to a Rajapur
                        Saraswat Brahmin[better source needed] Maharastrian family.[29][30] His father, Ramesh
                        Tendulkar, was a Marathi-language novelist and poet while his mother, Rajni, worked in the
                        insurance industry.[31] Tendulkar's father named him after his favourite music director, Sachin
                        Dev Burman.[32] Tendulkar has three older siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a
                        half-sister Savita. They were his father's children by his first wife, who died after the birth
                        of her third child.[33][34] His brother Ajit played in Bombay's Kanga Cricket League.[35]

                        Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra
                        (East). As a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and he often picked fights with new
                        children in his school.[36]
